v1.15 - 12/30/2023 - zl.css / zlhx improvements and documentation
------------------------------------------------
- zlhx misc improvements; added zlhxBefore and zlhxAfter auto-actions.
- zl::routeZLHX automatic/manual switch because auto can result in unexpected execution flow skip
- Reordered initialization procedure so you can be 100% sure you are in global scope at all possible injection points.

v1.13 - 07/14/2023 - zl.css improvements and misc
------------------------------------------------
- ZL debugger auto-enables for all HTMX requests, not just zlhx.
- Updated ZUI self-test to include new zl.css features.
- Fix for escape key not properly closing modal in zl.js.
- zl.css massive improvement to saturation and luminosity balance in material plus color scheme.
- zl.css theme system changes and misc improvements.
- zl.css classes shortened and refined, and number scales equalized and expanded.
- zl.css has improved margin and padding tags.
- zl.css now has a mobile columns system using flexbox which correctly emulates wordpress builders' responsive behavior.
- zl.css classes can be used shorthand without a zl_ prefix if a .zl class is further up in the DOM. This allows you to selectively turn on shorthand mode. This is a compromise between the original non-conflicting 'progressive enhancement' design and achieving shorter code in HTML vs tailwind and other alternatives.
- Added mode to put .zl in zpage output so that shorthand zl.css classes can be immediately used.

v1.1 - 06/12/2023 - HTMX improvements + zauth
------------------------------------------------
- zlhx demo updated to be more clear and use more HTMX functions.
- Automatic animation on target element during HTMX transfers.
- zlhx no longer has hxvar1/2/3/4 etc; use arbitrary variables. ( turns out to be better )
- zlhx:: now has additional magic functions, check zl::routeHX() for details.
- zlhx now writes the last zlhx function to zl::$lastZLHXfunc in case you need to refer to it in a hxfunc.
- zauth class to verify against logins set with zl::setUser() - for use with zpanel utilities inside application, or cross-application session functionality.

v1.09 - 06/08/2023 - zl.css color tuning round
------------------------------------------------
- New default color palette: Material Plus. This extends the dynamic range of the material design palette by changing the luminance curve and adds a 11th color shade that is darker. The saturation curve is also adjusted, and 5% saturation is taken out overall to reduce the neon-ness of the palette.
- In zl.css, bw1-11 added as an alternate syntax for 'grey'.
- Old palette refactored, and rest of CSS refactored to accommodate this.
- Button and notify object's coloring/appearance is improved.
- ZL error quips are now red to help distinguish them from the UI.
- Added authentication class. use zl::setUser() in your initialization to take advantage of it.

v1.08 - 06/01/2023 - Huge debugger improvement and printTable() improvements
------------------------------------------------
- Improved PHP hard fault detection in the debugger; PHP natively sends shutdown signal during hard parse/compile errors instead of forwarding to the exception handler. This caused the debugger to not display the error. We can capture most of these instances and display debugger errors in response now.
- zui::printTable()'s 4th parameter is $showFields now, and the feature works exactly as it does on ZPTA ( becomes a whitelist if not empty ).

v1.07 - 05/23/2023 - JS Overhaul
------------------------------------------------
- New zl2.js ( static class oriented ) and modal system. Modal cannot do submodals yet.
