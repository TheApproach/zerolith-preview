**Scales**

Spaces:   0 to 6 scale settable with zl_theme.css
Shadows:  0 to 6 scale, with 1 being a 1px shadow, 6 being a non-blurry, strong and far shadow
Colors:   1 to 11 scale, slightly biased towards lighter shades, with 1 being a hair from white, and 11 being close to black.
Opacity:  0 to 10 scale, exactly correlating with opacity percentage
Fades:    Arbitrary percentage scale with 11 units
W/H:      Arbitrary percentage scale or arbitrary pixel scale 
B.points: 1 to 3 scale; mobile, tablet, desktop

**Syntax rules**

After the zl_ part, camelCase is always the remainder.
zl_ serves as a namespace to prevent conflict with existing CSS.

zl.css is highly optimized for autocomplete according to how autocomplete works in VS Code and IntelliJ IDEs such as PHPStorm.
It follows a logical order; here are some examples:

Class name    [n.space][function][variant(s)][operator][scale num.]  Translation:
zl_bordRBlue5    zl_     bord        RBlue                5          border, right, blue, scale 5
zl_mar-5         zl_     mar                      -       5          margin, negative, 5
zl_bgAmber3      zl_     b.ground    Amber                3          background, amber, 3

**How to use it?**

See zl.css; the file is simple enough to read and learn.

**How does mobile/tablet compatibility work?**

( to be documented; not fully worked out; based on adding and removing elements based on breakpoints, and also flexbox functionality )

**Flexbox columns system**

( to be documented, see zl.css and testZui.php for examples of it in use )
